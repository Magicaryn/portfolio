Magicaryn's portfolio!

This is the first step toward my future as a developer. This portfolio is going to be a way i can showcase my work to anyone to see what skill i have to offer and what kind of designs and styles i am capable of. 

My portfolio does not have any links to current projects as i am brand new in the developing world but they will be added as time progresses. I have active links at the top of the page as a nav bar for you to access those sections of the page as well as links at the bottom to a couple of my social medias. I have, in place of the projects, have placeholders showing some of my favorite things. This was a challenge for me as it was my first time ever writing and html and css document completely from scratch. It tested my problem solving skills as i was building the application. I learned a lot about how to place items and what types of commands impact the visual aspects in the application.
